          <h2>8. Limited Warranty.</h2>
          <p>
            Code Effects warrants solely to You that the Software will perform substantially in accordance with the
            accompanying written materials for a period of
            ninety (90) days after the date on which You purchase the License for the Software. Code Effects does not
            warrant that the use of the Software will
            be uninterrupted or error free at all times and in all circumstances, nor that program errors will be
            corrected. This limited warranty shall not apply
            to any error or failure resulting from (i) machine error, (ii) Your failure to follow operating
            instructions, (iii) negligence or accident, or
            (iv) modifications to the Software by any person or entity other than Code Effects. In event of a breach of
            warranty, Your sole and exclusive remedy
            and Code Effects’ sole and exclusive liability shall be a refund of the license purchase price for the
            defective Software only. This limited warranty
            is valid only if Code Effects receives written notice of breach of warranty no later than ninety (90) days
            after the warranty period expires.

          <p>
            EXCEPT FOR THE EXPRESS WARRANTIES SET FORTH IN THIS SECTION 8, CODE EFFECTS DISCLAIMS ALL OTHER WARRANTIES,
            EXPRESS OR IMPLIED,

          <h2>9. Limitation of Liability.</h2>
          <p>
            To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, in no event shall Code Effects be liable for any
            indirect, special, incidental, or consequential
            damages arising out of the use of or inability to use the Software, including, without limitation, damages
            for loss of goodwill, work stoppage,
            computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses, even if advised of the
            possibility thereof, and regardless of
            the legal or equitable theory (contract, tort or otherwise) upon which the claim is based. In any case, Code
            Effects’ entire liability under any
            provision of this Agreement shall not exceed in the aggregate the sum of the license fees Licensee paid to
            Code Effects for the Software giving
            rise to such damages, notwithstanding any failure of essential purpose of any limited remedy. Some
            jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or
            limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so this exclusion and limitation may not be applicable.
            Code Effects is not responsible for
            any liability arising out of content provided by Licensee or a third party that is accessed through the
            Software and/or any material linked
            through such content. Any data included in the Software upon shipment from Code Effects is for testing use
            only and Code Effects hereby
            disclaims any and all liability arising therefrom.

          <h2>10. Indemnity.</h2>
          <p>
            You agree to indemnify, hold harmless, and defend Code Effects and its suppliers from and against any and
            all claims, lawsuits and proceedings
            (collectively “Claims”), and all expenses, costs (including attorney’s fees), judgments, damages and other
            liabilities resulting from such Claims,
            that arise or result from the use of or distribution of Your Integrated Product.

          <h2>11. Confidentiality.</h2>
          <p>
            Except as otherwise provided herein, each party expressly undertakes to retain in confidence all information
            and know-how transmitted or disclosed
            to the other that the disclosing party has identified as being proprietary and/or confidential, or that by
            the nature of the circumstances surrounding
            the disclosure, ought in good faith to be treated as proprietary and/or confidential, and each party agrees
            to make no use of such information and
            know-how except under the terms and during the existence of this Agreement. However, neither party shall
            have an obligation to maintain the
            confidentiality of information that: (i) it received properly from a third party without any obligation to
            maintain such information in confidence;
            (ii) was known to it prior to receipt from the other party; (iii) is or becomes a matter of public knowledge
            through no fault of its own; or
            (iv) is required by law to be disclosed. The receiving party shall be allowed to disclose such confidential
            information to the extent required by
            law or by a valid order of a court of competent jurisdiction or government agency, provided that the
            receiving party provides the disclosing party
            with prompt written notice of such requirement prior to disclosure and cooperates with the disclosing party
            in attempting to limit the scope of such
            disclosure, at the disclosing party’s expense. Neither party shall disclose the confidential information of
            the other party to any person or entity
            other than its officers, employees, consultants and legal and financial advisors who need access to such
            confidential information in order to effect
            the intent of this Agreement and who are bound by a written nondisclosure agreement with terms no less
            restrictive than those contained herein.
            All confidential information shall remain the sole property of the disclosing party. Nothing contained
            herein shall be construed as granting or
            conferring rights by license or otherwise in any confidential information disclosed under this Agreement.
            All confidential information is provided
            “AS IS” and without any warranty, express, implied or otherwise, regarding its accuracy or performance. Each
            party’s obligation of nondisclosure
            under this Section 11 shall apply (i) while this Agreement is in effect and (ii) for two (2) years following
            termination of this Agreement.
